# VexLiveOperation
This was my first real experience with writing wrappers for other people's code.  I have a decent amount of experience working with Robots, so creating a Live control mode wasnt' too difficult.  Even less so thanks to the communication protocol already being completed.
My only true endeavour with this project was to make it easier to use.  My primary contributions to this project were a PacketWrapper to make it easy to read communication code and a system to turn any device that Java can interface with into a controller.  Additionally, I added some logging functionality to monitor the connection between your computer and the robot.
